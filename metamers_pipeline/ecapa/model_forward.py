        """Encodes the input audio into a single vector embedding.

        The waveforms should already be in the model's desired format.
        You can call:
        ``normalized = <this>.normalizer(signal, sample_rate)``
        to get a correctly converted signal in most cases.

        Arguments
        ---------
        wavs : torch.Tensor
            Batch of waveforms [batch, time, channels] or [batch, time]
            depending on the model. Make sure the sample rate is fs=16000 Hz.
        wav_lens : torch.Tensor
            Lengths of the waveforms relative to the longest one in the
            batch, tensor of shape [batch]. The longest one should have
            relative length 1.0 and others len(waveform) / max_length.
            Used for ignoring padding.
        normalize : bool
            If True, it normalizes the embeddings with the statistics
            contained in mean_var_norm_emb.

        Returns
        -------
        torch.Tensor
            The encoded batch
